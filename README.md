# Petproject - Weather App

## About the project
The Weather App is a personal project developed using React and TypeScript,
designed to provide users with a seamless and intuitive experience for accessing weather information.
This application leverages the power of React to create a responsive and dynamic user interface,
ensuring a smooth and engaging interaction.

With TypeScript, the project benefits from static typing, enhancing code quality and developer productivity
by catching potential errors early in the development process.
The app currently integrates with a fake JSON server API to fetch fake weather data.

Key features of the Weather App include a user-friendly interface with interactive components,
such as a search bar for location input and visually appealing weather displays.
TypeScript's type-checking capabilities contribute to the robustness of the codebase,
making it easier to maintain and extend the application in the future.

The Weather App serves as a practical showcase of how the combination of React and TypeScript
can be employed to create a modern, efficient, and user-centric web application for staying informed
about the latest weather conditions.

## Plans for future development
* The app integrates with weather APIs to fetch real-time weather data,
presenting users with accurate and up-to-date information about their selected locations.
* Implement react-icons to showcase the current weather conditions.

## Start the app
`yarn start`

## Start the fake server
